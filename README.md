- **Multi-Cylinder Support**: Configurable for single, twin, triple, and quad cylinder engines
- **V-Twin Optimized**: Tuned for V-Twin engines like Victory and Harley-Davidson

### **Fuel Consumption Modeling**
- **RPM + Speed Integration**: Far more accurate than GPS-only tracking
- **Load-Aware Calculations**: Detects gear changes, hills, and acceleration via RPM analysis  
- **Engine Efficiency Curves**: Models real motorcycle engine performance characteristics
- **Smart Idle Detection**: Configurable idle consumption rates (gallons/hour)

### **PWA Implementation**
- **iOS/Android Compatible**: Full PWA support with offline capability
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Speed, RPM, MPG, fuel used, range, trip distance
- **Pause/Resume Functionality**: Stop tracking when engine is off
- **Persistent Settings**: All calibration data saved locally

## üîß Current Status: v2.0.2
